    - #### VPC

        On Alibaba Cloud official website, it states:

        > Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private network established in Alibaba Cloud. VPCs are logically isolated from other virtual networks in Alibaba Cloud.
        VPC is a private network dedicated to you in Alibaba Cloud. You have full control over your VPC, such as specifying its IP address range, and configuring route tables and network gateways. You can also use Alibaba Cloud resources such as ECS, RDS, and SLB in your own VPC.

        If you are already familiar with AWS VPC, the AliCloud VPC is pretty much the same in terms of features and use cases.
        An AliCloud VPC provides the following features:


        - Multiple availability zones _(AZs)_
        - Cross vpc connections _(VPC peering)_
        - Vpc to on-prem connections _(Express connect/Direct connect)_
        - Gateway
        - VRouter
        - VSwitch _(route table)_
        - Subnets with customize cidr block
        - Elastic ips _(EIPs)_

        We won't dive into much detail of its architecture here, but you can refer to [this documentation](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/34221.htm) on Alibaba Cloud's VPC design.

        Here is a diagram shows what a typical VPC in AliCloud looks like:

        Here is a screencast of Alibaba Cloud VPC console dashboard. You can have a quick look of the basic features:

        Limitations of VPC resources:

        | Items    | Limits  | Increasable    |
        | ----- |:------------- | :------------|
        | Available CIDR blocks | 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8, and their subsets | Supported |
        | Maximum number of VPCs for an account | 10 | Supported |
        | Maximum number of VRouters in a VPC | 1 | Unsupported |
        | Maximum number of VSwitches in a VPC	| 24 |  Unsupported |
        | Maximum number of route tables in a VPC | 1 | Unsupported |
        | Maximum number of route entries in a route table | 48 | Supported |
        | Maximum number of cloud product instances that can run in a VPC | 10,000 | Unsupported |
        | VRouter | <ul><li>Each VPC can have only one VRouter</li><li>VRouter does not support dynamic route protocols, such as BGP or OSPF</li><li>Each VRouter has only one route table</li><li>Route entries in a route table affect all the cloud product instances in the VPC. Currently, the source IP routing rules are not supported by VSwitches and cloud product instances</li></ul> | N/A |
        | VRouter | <ul><li>VSwitches are a layer-3 switch, therefore the layer-2 broadcast and multicast are not supported</li><li>he number of instances that a VSwitch can have = 10,000 - the number of existing instances in the VPC</li><li>The CIDR block cannot be modified</li></ul> | N/A |

    - #### Server Load Balancer

        On Alibaba Cloud official website, it states:

        > Alibaba Cloud Server Load Balancer is built to cope with high volume traffic and each year in November is put to the test during Alibabaâ€™s annual Global Shopping Festival. Alibaba relies on Server Load Balancer to provide uninterrupted service during the festival by switching requests between data centers and transferring transactions to the most available server. This includes transferring requests to servers located over 1,000 kilometers away, without missing a single transaction.

        A managed load balancer can, literally, automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple server instances in the cloud. It enables our application to achieve greater levels of fault tolerance, seamlessly providing the required amount of load balancing capacity needed to distribute application traffic.

        The AliCloud Server Load Balancer (SLB) has the following main features:

        - High availability
        - Cross-zone load balancing
        - Health checks
        - Works with Auto Scaling
        - Supports HTTPS protocal
        - Supports session stickness
        - Supports global load balancing and cross-region disaster recovery when used in combination with DNS
        - Guarantees up to 99.9% availability

        We won't dive into much detail of SLB here, but you can refer to [this documentation](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/server-load-balancer) on Alibaba Cloud's SLB documentation.

        Here is a diagram shows what a typical SLB in AliCloud looks like:

    - #### Express Connect

        Express connect provides a fast, stable, secure and private or dedicated network communication between different cloud environments, including VPC intranet intercommunication and dedicated leased line connection across regions and users.

        > Think of Express Connect as AWS Direct Connect

        View official Express Connect [documentation here](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/express-connect).

    - #### Cloud DNS

        Alibaba Cloud DNS (Domain Name System) is an authoritative highly available and highly scalable domain name resolution and management service.

        Key features:

        - Mapping Between Domain Names and IP Addresses
        - GEO DNS

        > Think of Cloud DNS as AWS Route53

        View official Cloud DNS [documentation here](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/dns).

    - #### Cloud CDN

       Alibaba Cloud CDN is a Content Delivery Network (a.k.a CDN). Alibaba Cloud CDN has 1,200+ nodes distributed across the globe, it enables users to effectively reduce website response time to milliseconds, ensure smooth video streaming and handle large volumes of traffic.

        > Think of Cloud DNS as AWS CloudFront
