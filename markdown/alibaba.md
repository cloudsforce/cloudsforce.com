    - #### VPC

        On Alibaba Cloud official website, it states:

        > Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private network established in Alibaba Cloud. VPCs are logically isolated from other virtual networks in Alibaba Cloud.
        VPC is a private network dedicated to you in Alibaba Cloud. You have full control over your VPC, such as specifying its IP address range, and configuring route tables and network gateways. You can also use Alibaba Cloud resources such as ECS, RDS, and SLB in your own VPC.

        If you are already familiar with AWS VPC, the AliCloud VPC is pretty much the same in terms of features and use cases.
        An AliCloud VPC provides the following features:


        - Multiple availability zones _(AZs)_
        - Cross vpc connections _(VPC peering)_
        - Vpc to on-prem connections _(Express connect/Direct connect)_
        - Gateway
        - VRouter
        - VSwitch _(route table)_
        - Subnets with customize cidr block
        - Elastic ips _(EIPs)_

        We won't dive into much detail of its architecture here, but you can refer to [this documentation](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/34221.htm) on Alibaba Cloud's VPC design.

        Here is a diagram shows what a typical VPC in AliCloud looks like:

        Limitations of VPC resources:

        | Items    | Limits  | Increasable    |
        | ----- |:------------- | :------------|
        | Available CIDR blocks | 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8, and their subsets | Supported |
        | Maximum number of VPCs for an account | 10 | Supported |
        | Maximum number of VRouters in a VPC | 1 | Unsupported |
        | Maximum number of VSwitches in a VPC	| 24 |  Unsupported |
        | Maximum number of route tables in a VPC | 1 | Unsupported |
        | Maximum number of route entries in a route table | 48 | Supported |
        | Maximum number of cloud product instances that can run in a VPC | 10,000 | Unsupported |
        | VRouter | <ul><li>Each VPC can have only one VRouter</li><li>VRouter does not support dynamic route protocols, such as BGP or OSPF</li><li>Each VRouter has only one route table</li><li>Route entries in a route table affect all the cloud product instances in the VPC. Currently, the source IP routing rules are not supported by VSwitches and cloud product instances</li></ul> | N/A |
        | VRouter | <ul><li>VSwitches are a layer-3 switch, therefore the layer-2 broadcast and multicast are not supported</li><li>he number of instances that a VSwitch can have = 10,000 - the number of existing instances in the VPC</li><li>The CIDR block cannot be modified</li></ul> | N/A |

    - #### Server Load Balancer

        On Alibaba Cloud official website, it states:

        > Alibaba Cloud Server Load Balancer is built to cope with high volume traffic and each year in November is put to the test during Alibabaâ€™s annual Global Shopping Festival. Alibaba relies on Server Load Balancer to provide uninterrupted service during the festival by switching requests between data centers and transferring transactions to the most available server. This includes transferring requests to servers located over 1,000 kilometers away, without missing a single transaction.

        A managed load balancer can, literally, automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple server instances in the cloud. It enables our application to achieve greater levels of fault tolerance, seamlessly providing the required amount of load balancing capacity needed to distribute application traffic.

        The AliCloud Server Load Balancer (SLB) has the following main features:

        - High availability
        - Cross-zone load balancing
        - Health checks
        - Works with Auto Scaling
        - Supports HTTPS protocal
        - Supports session stickness
        - Supports global load balancing and cross-region disaster recovery when used in combination with DNS
        - Guarantees up to 99.9% availability

        We won't dive into much detail of SLB here, but you can refer to [this documentation](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/server-load-balancer) on Alibaba Cloud's SLB documentation.
