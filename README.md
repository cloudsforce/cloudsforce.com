# What is Cloudsforce.com
A community driven, pubic cloud platforms resource and knowledge sharing website.

The goal of this open source repo is to have community members to collaborate on its contents while minimizing the operation of running the website.


# Installations

To test and run the site on your local environment, you'll need to have a apache server running php.

You can either download and install [MAMP](mamp.info) for your local mac development, or have a [docker](www.docker.com) running appropriate apache and php images.

You need to have [PHP composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed on your machine first.

Then navigate into code source folder, and run:

```
composer install
```
