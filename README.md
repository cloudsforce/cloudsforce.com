# What is Cloudsforce.com
A community driven, cloud resource and experience sharing collaboration website.

The goal of this open source repo is to minimize the operation of running such site, while having community members to collaborate on its contents.


# Installations

To test and run the site on your local environment, you'll need to have a apache server running php. 

You can either download and install [MAMP](mamp.info) for your local mac development, or have a [docker](www.docker.com) running appropriate apache and php images.

# Contribution Folders

The project owners will maintain the structure and code logic of this repo, while contributors mostly working on `markdown` folers only.

Each markdown file represents a single page found on cloudsforce.com. 

For the page routing structures you can check on `routes` folder for reference.
